                <p>Hello! My name is Tiifany, and I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Arizona. Growing up in
                    the desert, it might seem surprising, but one of my greatest passions is being on or near the water.
                    There's something incredibly serene and rejuvenating about the sound of waves crashing against the
                    shore or the gentle ripple of a tranquil lake. When I'm not daydreaming about oceanic adventures,
                    you can often find me jamming out to the tunes of Taylor Swift. Her music has a way of capturing
                    emotions and experiences in a relatable and heartfelt manner that speaks to my soul. Another one of
                    my cherished pastimes is visiting Disneyland. The magical atmosphere, exhilarating rides, and
                    enchanting characters make me feel like a kid again. Lastly, I have an insatiable wanderlust. In
                    2020, I embarked on an unforgettable journey to Russia, where I volunteered as an English teacher.
                    The experience was eye-opening, allowing me to immerse myself in a new culture while also helping
                    others. Additionally, I've had the opportunity to travel within the United States, working in
                    breathtaking places such as Alaska, Yellowstone, and Idaho, where nature's splendor never fails to
                    leave me in awe.</p>

                <p>Driven by my desire for personal and professional growth, I recently made a significant decision to
                    join the ASU Coding Bootcamp, aiming to learn a new skill and pursue a career change. The world of
                    coding has always fascinated me, with its limitless potential to create, innovate, and solve
                    problems. Eager to delve into this exciting realm, I enrolled in the bootcamp to gain comprehensive
                    knowledge in programming languages, web development, and software engineering. The rigorous
                    curriculum and hands-on projects have challenged me, pushing the boundaries of my problem-solving
                    abilities while fostering collaboration within a dynamic learning environment. Through this
                    immersive experience, I am equipping myself with the necessary tools and skills to thrive in the
                    ever-evolving field of technology. With a newfound passion for coding and a determination to make a
                    meaningful impact, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as I embark on this
                    transformative journey towards a fulfilling career in the world of tech.</p>
